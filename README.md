This is a simple yet functional payload service, that meant to mock real world 
service behavior. 

Abstract
---

Any service can be unpredictably slow in a startup or shutdown processes, as 
well as, it can accidentally exit or, in opposite, resist to become terminated 
from external command.

Moreover, such real-world services, can easily exceed any limits, like CPU time 
or granted RAM.
